# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Ensuring robust support for file attachments (audio, video, images, documents) in the chat UI.
- Enabling inline playback and preview for supported media types using direct CDN links (Discord CDN).

## Recent Changes

- Updated frontend to correctly render attachments from backend responses.
- Verified that Discord CDN links work for inline playback; Google Drive links do not due to CORS/redirect issues.
- Confirmed that all major file handling and media playback features are now working as intended.

## Next Steps

- Optional: Add backend proxy support for streaming files from non-CDN sources (e.g., Google Drive).
- Optional: Enhance error handling and user feedback for failed media loads.
- Optional: Add support for more file types or advanced media controls.
